				<h1>An NXP i.MX Update</h1>

			<p>A quick look into the 2018Q1 status of the i.MX 6 & 8 platforms.</p>

<p>The i.MX6 platform has for the past few years enjoyed a large effort to add
upstream support to Linux and surrounding projects. Now it is at the point
where nothing is really missing any more. Improvements are still being made,
to the graphics driver for i.MX 6, but functionally it is complete.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018-04-13_timeline_vivante_kernel_and_mesa.svg"><img alt="Etnaviv driver development timeline" src="/images/2018-04-13_timeline_vivante_kernel_and_mesa.svg">
</a></p>
<p>The i.MX8 is a different story. The newly introduced platform, with hardware still difficult to get access to, is seeing lots of work being done, but much
still remains to be done.</p>
<p>That being said, initial support for the GPU, the Vivante GC7000, is in place
and is able to successfully run Wayland/Weston, glmark, etc.</p>
<p>An upstream display/scanout driver does currently not exist, but a driver is provided by the NXP base support package.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018-04-13_timeline_imx8qm_kernel.svg"><img alt="i.MX8 Kernel Support" src="/images/2018-04-13_timeline_imx8qm_kernel.svg">
</a></p>
<p>The direct support for the i.MX8 that has landed in the kernel at this point is mostly done by NXP engineers.</p>
<p>But there are lots of components that currently have no support. The Video Processor Unit IP, the Hantro G1/G2, does not have any upstream support.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2018-04-13_timeline_imx8qm_i.mx_8_u-boot.svg"><img alt="i.MX8 U-Boot Support" src="/images/2018-04-13_timeline_imx8qm_i.mx_8_u-boot.svg">
</a></p>
<p>Looking at bootloader support, U-Boot has good support for the i.MX 8M platform
since early 2018, and can be expected to just work.</p>
<h2>Looking forward</h2>
<p>While lot's of support is still missing for the i.MX 8, the platform
is under active development, with many new pieces of the hardware seeing attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a> is one of the vendors who currently is actively
working towards full Open Source support of the i.MX8 platform.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
