Description: As an experiment in HW design an alternative to the Philips Hue was built. It's fully programmable over WiFi.

The product of this project is a WiFi connected LED bulb. Every LED on this bulb is individually programmable over the WiFi, by simply sending UDP packets to the bulb.

## Software and hardware sources

    git clone https://github.com/robertfoss/esp8266_apa102_bulb.git


[This project](https://github.com/robertfoss/esp8266_apa102_bulb) consists of 3 parts: the software running on the led bulb, the software running on some host computer and the hardware.


### Firmware

The firmare is based on the [NodeMCU](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware) firwmare for the ESP8266. It's running the APA102 LED driver and the enduser setup module, which I've written about [previously](../user-friendly-setup-of-esp8266-gadgets.html).

Additionally it's running 3 lua scripts that deal with different aspects.

There's init.lua which makes sure we're connected to a WiFi.

udp_listener.lua receives UDP packets and then sends forwards that data to the APA102 strips.

And lastly udb_broadcast.lua which periodically broadcasts a heartbeat for this LED bulb to signal that it is alive and well.

### Host application

The current (as of the publish date of this post) incarnation of the host application listens for bulbs that are alive on the hosts network. If a bulb is found is will be added to the list of bulbs to be animated. All animations are simple and sinusoidal and only use the time a bulb has been 'alive' as an input for the animation.


### Hardware

The hardware is based around the ESP8266 WiFi IC and the APA102 SPI LED IC.

The flavor of ESP8266 used in this project is the ESP12-F module, since it the latest module available with the integrated antenna form factor.

APA102 was chosen instead of the much more common WS2812B chip, since it uses a SPI like protocol which isn't timing sensitive and also does not require external capacitors at next to each LED.
