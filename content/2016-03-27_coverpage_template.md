Coverpage is a single-page landing page built to showcase an idea or a product. To allow interested parties to get notified of updates, the template has mailchimp subscription integration.

A live version of the site can be found at [coverpage.memcpy.io](http://coverpage.memcpy.io).

## GitHub hosting

This template was built with the explicit intention of having it be hosted at GitHub in a gh-pages branch.
Therefore it includes a Makefile for pushing copy of the current design to a gh-pages branch.
