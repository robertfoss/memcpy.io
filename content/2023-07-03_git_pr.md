Description: Working with GitHub and GitLab pull/merge requests can be improved greatly by adding an alias for fetching all requests. Fetched PRs can then easily be searched or checked out.

[Adam Jackson](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ajax) created the script [add-gitlab-merge-requests.sh](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/util/modular/-/raw/master/add-gitlab-merge-requests.sh?inline=false) which is the basis of this workflow.

## git pr

The idea is to provide local access to all of the PRs that exist upstream. This both provides a better general overview of which PRs that have been pulled into the branch you're working on, but also enables you to search the contents of all PRs.

This function automagically detects if your remote is hosted on GitHub or GitLab and makes the necessary adjustments to work on either platform.

    [alias]
      mr = pr
      pr = "!f() { \
        REMOTES=$(git remote); \
        REMOTE=\"origin\"; \
        case \"$REMOTES\" in \
        *upstream*) \
          REMOTE=\"upstream\"; \
        ;; \
        esac; \
        \
        ORIGIN=${1:-${REMOTE}}; \
        URL=$(git remote get-url ${ORIGIN}); \
        \
        case \"$URL\" in \
        *gitlab*) \
          FORGE_EXT="mr" \
          FORGE_PATH="merge-requests" \
        ;; \
        *github*) \
          FORGE_EXT="pr" \
          FORGE_PATH="pull" \
        ;; \
        esac; \
        ORIGIN_NAME=${ORIGIN}-${FORGE_EXT}; \
        git remote add ${ORIGIN_NAME} ${URL}; \
        git config remote.${ORIGIN_NAME}.fetch "+refs/${FORGE_PATH}/*/head:refs/remotes/${ORIGIN_NAME}/*"; \
        git fetch ${ORIGIN_NAME}; \
      }; f"

The syntax is `git pr [remote]`.

`[remote]` will default to the `upstream` remote if available or `origin` if it isn't available.


```
$ git pr

```

## git search-all

`git search-all` or `git sa` is used for search all commits in a repository. When used in conjunction with `git pr` this enables searching through all PRs to look for previous implementations of functionality for example.

    [alias]
        search-all = sa
        sa = "!f() { git log --all --color --pretty=log --abbrev-commit -S\"$1\" $2; }; f"

    [pretty]
        log = %Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset


With both of these additions you'll be able to search PR commits for strings and have the relevant PR id listed in the search output.


```
$ git sa "~/.local/share"
91a92e5 - (upstream-mr/192) cursor: add XDG_DATA_DIRS to xcursor search path (10 months ago) <catsout>
0aebb5b - (upstream-mr/112) cursor: add one more directory to XCURSORPATH (2 years, 2 months ago) <Alexander Dunaev>
```
