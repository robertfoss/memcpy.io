Hi! I'm Robert Foss. I'm a software engineer, and **memcpy** is my software consulting business.

When I'm not busy writing software for work, I typically do it for fun. I'm a contributor of a few open source [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/), [Mesa](http://www.mesa3d.org/), [NodeMCU](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware), [I2P](https://geti2p.net) and of course all the projects I've spawned on [GitHub](https://github.com/robertfoss).

When I'm not writing software, I do in electronics design and manufacturing. Most of these project can be seen on this blog. Some are close to almost at the finished product stage, while some are a bit more hacked together.
While venturing into the land of electronics I've also grown an interest in manufacturing and design for manufacturing.

Feel free to contact me at [contact@memcpy.io](mailto:contact@memcpy.io).
