This driver has recently seen a lot new attention and is itself progressing quickly,
which means it will be accepted in the kernel and Mesa soon.&lt;br&gt;
A piece of trivia is that this GPU architecture was what Arm received when they
purchased the Norwegian GPU IP vendor Falanx Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mali T and G-series of GPUs are based on the Midgard and Bifrost architectures
respectively, both of which are quite different from the 2/3/400 series.
However the T and G-series are somewhat similar at least …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Robert Foss</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 16:25:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:memcpy.io,2019-03-13:/an-overview-of-the-panfrost-driver.html</guid><category>linux</category><category>open source</category><category>gpu</category><category>driver</category><category>arm</category><category>mali</category><category>panfrost</category></item></channel></rss>
