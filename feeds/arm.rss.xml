&lt;p&gt;The process of reverse engineering Arm GPUs has been going on for a long time,
starting with &lt;a href="https://github.com/libv"&gt;Luc Verhaegens&lt;/a&gt; work on the low-end Mali 2/3/400 series of GPUs based
on the Arm Utgard family of GPUs.&lt;br&gt;
This driver has recently seen a lot new attention and is itself progressing quickly,
which means it will likely be accepted into the kernel soon.&lt;br&gt;
A piece of trivia is that this GPU architecture was what Arm received when they
purchased the Norwegian GPU IP vendor Falanx Microsystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mali T and G-series of GPUs are based on the Midgard and Bifrost architectures
respectively, both of which are quite different from the 2/3/400 series.
However the T and G-series are somewhat similar at least when â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Robert Foss</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2019 18:01:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:memcpy.io,2019-04-01:/running-android-with-wayland.html</guid><category>linux</category><category>open source</category><category>gpu</category><category>driver</category><category>arm</category><category>mali</category><category>panfrost</category></item></channel></rss>
