&lt;p&gt;The i.MX6 platform has for the past few years enjoyed a large effort to add
upstream support to Linux and surrounding projects. Now it is at the point
where nothing is really missing any more. Improvements are still being made,
to the graphics driver for i.MX 6, but functionally it is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The i.MX8 is a different story. The newly introduced platform, with hardware still difficult to get access to, is seeing lots of work being done, but much
still remains to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
